## AI Ethics Assignment
####Description      Assignment: AI Ethics
Theme: "Designing Responsible and Fair AI Systems" 🌍⚖️

### Objective & Guidelnes
This assignment evaluates the understanding of AI ethics principles, ability to identify and mitigate biases, and skill in applying ethical frameworks to real-world scenarios. You will analyze case studies, audit AI systems, and propose solutions to ethical dilemmas.

### Tools & Resources
Libraries: AI Fairness 360, Pandas, Matplotlib.
Datasets: COMPAS (provided), ProPublica’s Analysis. https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm
Frameworks: EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai

Why This Matters
Societal Impact: Ethical AI prevents harm and fosters trust in technology.
Career Skill: Employers prioritize ethical competency in AI roles.
Build AI that’s fair, transparent, and human-centric! 🌟

Pro Tip: Start with fairness metrics like disparate impact ratio and equal opportunity difference. Small steps lead to big ethical wins!       
Part 1: Theoretical Understanding 
1. Short Answer Questions
Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?
2. Ethical Principles Matching
Match the following principles to their definitions:
A) Justice
B) Non-maleficence
C) Autonomy
D) Sustainability
Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.
Respecting users’ right to control their data and decisions.
Designing AI to be environmentally friendly.
Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.


Part 2: Case Study Analysis 
Case 1: Biased Hiring Tool
Scenario: Amazon’s AI recruiting tool penalized female candidates.
Tasks:
Identify the source of bias (e.g., training data, model design).
Propose three fixes to make the tool fairer.
Suggest metrics to evaluate fairness post-correction.

Case 2: Facial Recognition in Policing
Scenario: A facial recognition system misidentifies minorities at higher rates.
Tasks:
Discuss ethical risks (e.g., wrongful arrests, privacy violations).
Recommend policies for responsible deployment.

Part 3: Practical Audit 
Task: Audit a Dataset for Bias
Dataset: COMPAS Recidivism Dataset. https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/compas-recidivism-risk-score-data-and-analysis

Goal:
Use Python and AI Fairness 360 (IBM’s toolkit) to analyze racial bias in risk scores.
Generate visualizations (e.g., disparity in false positive rates).
Write a 300-word report summarizing findings and remediation steps.
Deliverable: Code + report.

Part 4: Ethical Reflection 
Prompt: Reflect on a personal project (past or future). How will you ensure it adheres to ethical AI principles?
Bonus Task 
Policy Proposal: Draft a 1-page guideline for ethical AI use in healthcare. Include:
Patient consent protocols.
Bias mitigation strategies.
Transparency requirements.
